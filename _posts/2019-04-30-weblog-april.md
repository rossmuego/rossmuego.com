# April

As part of the dynamically changing team structure we have in order to try not keep our knowledge in silos, and to spend time working in all aspects of the system, I have recently moved teams into a team working on implementing a feature from a previous version of our product to the current version.

The most difficult part about changing teams was getting a grip on the work that they were doing, which I did thoroughly enjoy. The rest of the team were great at filling me in and keeping me updated on their progress, as well as constantly checking up on mine to make sure that everything was okay.

## The Work

I was tasked with taking some code from one of our controller methods and relocating it so that it could be shared amongst the controller and another area of the code that now needed to use it.

This was relatively straight forward and once I understood how the code worked, was able to relocate it with ease and make sure that it still functioned as planned in its new home.

My next job was to use the newly relocated code in the task that I was doing, which was to allow for [SPC chart sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_process_control) to be scheduled to print and be emailed to users.

I enjoyed learning about this area of the product as its something that isn't changed very often, so was a valuable learning experience. It also allowed me to lean a bit about SPC and why/where it is used.

### Back to the old team

Once I had completed the task involving the SPC Scheduling, I moved back to my old team. My focus this time was on dashboards, implementing a feature that would allow more customization for end users. This change didn't take me too long and I managed to do the majority of work myself with having to ask for second opinions or direction on where to go, something that I was quite proud of myself for.
