The largest project that I have undertaken yet, a booking system for a holiday resort. There were a number of different features requested be built into this system along with a number of basic tasks it must perform. This included:

* Adding/Removing/Altering Customers
* Adding/Removing/Altering Guests
* Adding/Removing/Altering Bookings
* Checking what chalets are available to book
* Creating an invoice for a booking

I incorporated a database into my solution in order to store bookings, customers and guests as well as keeping track of car hire and chalet availability. The database was stored locally in the solution for ease of demonstration/marking (as well as cost), however it could easily be connected to an online database.

This entire solution was programmed in C# with the database queries being carried out using SQL. I learnt a large number of things about the C# language during this process as well as how to implement an SQL database into my program and how to handle the data provided by it.
