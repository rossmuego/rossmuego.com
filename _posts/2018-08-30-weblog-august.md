# The Second Month

Having now completed my second month at Lighthouse, I feel its time to make another blog post detailing what I have been up to this month.

This month has been equally as fun and as engaging as the previous. I am coming into the final weeks of the training, meaning that fairly soon I will be fully trained and be working in the office. This is a scary prospect, since there is no distinction between the work that I will be doing and what the others will be doing.

Training has became a lot harder recently. We are exploring a lot more complex MES concepts as well as configuring a lot more within the system. We have completed the dedicated SQL training, however I am writing SQL every day and it is becoming more complex. The same goes for Stored Procedures, which is something that I was not familiar with when I first started the training.

Soon to come is the C# training. I am looking forward to this as I enjoy programming and look forward to putting my skills to use in real world scenarios.

## My time in the office

So since my last blog post, I have completed 2 weeks of work in the office. This was slightly daunting at first, considering I had only been training for a couple of weeks before being told to do work for our customers.

I have been put upstairs in the development office, which is where I had hoped I would be at the start of the training. I am not sure if this is where I will be when the training is over, but I have certainly enjoyed my time there so far.

To start out, I was given a big list of tasks that needed done. I could pick and choose whatever ones I wanted from the list, but there was only a few that I could actually work on since I still hadn't completed my training. Everyone was extremely helpful, with some people approaching me frequently asking me if I needed help with anything or if I was stuck.

Everyone was very approachable, and made me feel apart of the team straight away. I managed to work my way through some of the tasks and was happy with how things went. It was good to see what I had learnt in training being put to use in the real world.

As being a part of the team, I was shown and involved in the development process that take part. Every morning, I was included in the teams morning meeting to discuss how all our tasks were getting along and if we had any questions/queries as to anything. We would also have a look at all the work that still needing done and if there was any updates on it.

There are also a number of meetings that happen throughout a sprint. I was involved in the _Sprint Retrospective_ during my time (although I didn't necessarily have anything to bring to the table) which involved going over the last sprint, giving feedback and opinions on how it went and if anything could be improved. This sprint went well, so there was no real concerns or big points made. Other meetings include the _Sprint Review_, in which the work done in the last sprint is shown off to everyone, and _Sprint Planning_, which is where we decide what work is to be included in the new sprint, as well as sizing it up to make sure we don't take in more work than we have the capacity for.

## Performance so far

I have had a meeting with the training leader this month to catch up on how I am getting along. He seems impressed with my work so far, which is reassuring and giving me a boost of confidence going into the last few weeks.

## To Come

With only a couple more weeks of training to go, I am becoming a lot more confident in what I am doing at work, as well as having the confidence boost after being out in the office for a few weeks.
