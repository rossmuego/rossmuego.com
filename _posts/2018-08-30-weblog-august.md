## The Second Month

Having now completed my second month at Lighthouse, I feel its time to make another blog post detailing what I have been up to this month.

This month has been equally as fun and as engaging as the previous. I am coming into the final weeks of the training, meaning that fairly soon I will be fully trained and be working in the office. This is a scary prospect, since there is no distinction between the work that I will be doing and what the others will be doing.

Training has became a lot harder recently. We are exploring a lot more complex MES concepts as well as configuring a lot more within the system. We have completed the dedicated SQL training, however I am writing SQL every day and it is becoming more complex. The same goes for Stored Procedures, which is something that I was not familiar with when I first started the training.

Soon to come is the C# training. I am looking forward to this as I enjoy programming and look forward to putting my skills to use in real world scenarios.

## My time in the office

So since my last blog post, I have completed 2 weeks of work in the office. This was slightly daunting at first, considering I had only been training for a couple of weeks before being told to do work for our customers.

I have been put upstairs in the development office, which is where I had hoped I would be at the start of the training. I am not sure if this is where I will be when the training is over, but I have certainly enjoyed my time there so far.

To start out, I was given a big list of tasks that needed done. I could pick and choose whatever ones I wanted from the list, but there was only a few that I could actually work on since I still hadn't completed my training. Everyone was extremely helpful, with some people approaching me frequently asking me if I needed help with anything or if I was stuck.

Everyone was very approachable, and made me feel apart of the team straight away. I managed to work my way through some of the tasks and was happy with how things went. It was good to see what I had learnt in training being put to use in the real world.
