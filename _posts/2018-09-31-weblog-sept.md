# September

September has been a fun month for me. I have finally finished my training, had my birthday, and began to work in the office properly. I have felt my skills improve vastly as a result of working in the office as well as having completed all my training.

## Time in the office

So now that I am fully trained up, I am working full time in the office. I was much to my delight put in the development team when I finished my training, which was what I was hoping for. This has meant however that I have had to learn a lot of things that were not a part of the training since the training was mainly focused on the Implementation/Support teams.

The main differences between the Development and Implementation teams are how our task system works. The impli
ementation team use a custom task solution developed by us internally, whereas the development team use Microsofts TFS system.

TFS is the system where we track our sprints, our tasks, work needing done, work that is done, pull requests and pretty much anything you can think of that you would need to develop software. I have had to learn about things like Acceptance Criteria, Test Cases, the backlog, as well as all of the SCRUM meetings we have as part of our sprints.

I feel though by being apart of this, it will help me develop more as a software developer and hopefully provide a stepping stone in order to progress my career after university.

## The Work

As an inexperienced developer, so most of my work so far has been to do with the database. Maintaining stored procedures, queries and tables has been a good way for me to learn a bit more about the system as well as improve my skills. This is definitely a help for testing, since as a 'Newbie' I am taking part in a lot of testing.

As time goes on, I would like to be involved in more C#/TypeScript changes, however right now I am happy learning my way around the system and the development processes with the database work.

## Progress so far

This month I had a 1-1 meeting with my manager to discuss how things are going. I also had a meeting with the training leader again to go over how I done during the training as well as providing feedback to him on how I felt the training went.

Both meetings went well with both my manager and training leader happy with my progress, just as I am.
