I am kicking off my weblog for my third year placement at the end of July. I will make an attempt to make a weblog post each month, and they will be posted on this site. I decided to post monthly as I will be able to reflect more on the bigger moments that happen during my time, rather than creating a lot of smaller blog posts that are not meaningful or filled with unimportant information.

## July - First Month

So this month has been the first of many working at Lighthouse Systems. I started out by giving a short presentation on myself, as well as listening to presentations about other members of staff that will be taking the training. We were also introduced to our mentors, who we can go to with any problems or concerns, and done some fun activities to get to know some more about the company and its policies etc.

For the next 12 weeks, I will be taking part in an in depth training programme that will get my up to speed in order to work effectively for the next year. Mixed through the training I will be in the office working beside the people who I will eventually be working beside when I leave training.

## The first few weeks...

The first couple of weeks has been tough. We are focusing heavily on what a MES is (manufacturing Execution System) and how it works. This is all very foreign to me as I have no idea about the manufacturing industry.

There has been some SQL training, which I have enjoyed as this is something I thrived in at university last year. There is a large database structure here at Lighthouse so I have a lot yet to learn about how it works.

There has been a number of social events so far, with us having a pizza night and playing football/rounders after work to get to know some more of the staff. There has also been a couple of trips to the pub after.

## Whats to come

The next couple of weeks I will be learning more about MES and how our solution (Shopfloor Online) is configured and works. There will also be some more advanced SQL training along with our first week in the office.

I haven't had any problems or concerns so far with how I am performing or getting on with the job, it's been thoroughly enjoyable so far and I am looking forward to what will come next.
