I am kicking off my weblog for my third year placement at the end of July. I will make an attempt to make a weblog post each month, and they will be posted on this site. I decided to post monthly as I will be able to reflect more on the bigger moments that happen during my time, rather than creating a lot of smaller blog posts that are not meaningful or filled with unimportant information.

## July - First Month

So this month has been the first of many working at Lighthouse Systems.
